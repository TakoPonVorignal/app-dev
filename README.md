### **Spy x Family:** Code White🕶️🌸👨‍👩‍👧
**Plot** 
While under the guise of a weekend winter getaway, Anya gets involved in Operation Strix and triggers events that threaten world peace.

**Main Characters:**
- Loid Forger: The dad we all wish we had but way too busy saving the world.🕴️
- Yor Forger: Graceful yet lethal—a true queen who can kill you and also a genuinely kind person with strong maternal and big sister instincts. 🌹
- Anya Forger: Cutest telepath who somehow knows everything and still manages to cause trouble.🐾

**Why is it a Great Movie?:** 

This movie delivers action, comedy, and family feels all wrapped in beautiful animation. Watching the Forgers work together while keeping their secrets? Pure gold. It’s funny, emotional, and leaves you wanting to hug your family (even if they’re not spies).

**Favorite Quote:**

"Operation Strix isn’t just a mission; it’s about protecting what matters most."
